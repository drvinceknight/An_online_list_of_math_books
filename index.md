# A online (open) list of Mathematics Books
## Introduction
This site contains a list of books based on the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvXhcaIlhi4udEFIN1ZSUTRpakotUEZ6QmlEOWNua3c&hl=en&forcehl=1#gid=0) put up by [+James Noble](https://plus.google.com/102137382870708304914/posts).

[The spreadsheet is completely open and contains a list of books as well as well as a list of other lists](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvXhcaIlhi4udEFIN1ZSUTRpakotUEZ6QmlEOWNua3c&hl=en&forcehl=1#gid=0)

The list has been contributed to by 30 different contributors. As this page was compiled automatically and some of the contributors have left their email address (others their G+ page and/or twitter handle) I won't list them here in case it causes more spam but do go take a look at the spreadsheet :).

**Go ahead and add any book you have to the list!**

## Some initial analysis

I wrote some code to analyse (and in fact write the html behind this site) some aspects of the data set which (last time I checked) contains 65 books.

### Contributors

The list is completely open but some people seem to contribute more than others. Here's the distribution of the number of guesses:

![Distribution of the number of guesses](./images/Distribution_of_number_of_contributions.png)

### Authors

Similarly for the authors, here's the distribution of the number of books by author:

![Number of books](./images/Distribution_of_number_of_books_by_author.png)

The most prolific author is J. SCOTT CARTER with 5 books in the list.

### Overview

The list contains a data field allowing people to describe the book. Here is a plot of the frequency of the 50 most used "uncommon" words (using the [nltk](http://nltk.org/) python library).

![Words used in the overview](./images/Word_count_in_overview.png)

### Target

There is also a field briefly describing the target audience for the book. Here is a similar frequency count to above:

 **Authored** by EDWIN A ABBOT
**Overview:**

> 'Flatland is one of the very few novels about math and philosophy that can appeal to almost any layperson. Published in 1880, this short fantasy takes us to a completely flat world of two physical dimensions where all the inhabitants are geometric shapes, and who think the planar world of length and width that they know is all there is. But one inhabitant discovers the existence of a third physical dimension, enabling him to finally grasp the concept of a fourth dimension. Watching our Flatland narrator, we begin to get an idea of the limitations of our own assumptions about reality, and we start to learn how to think about the confusing problem of higher dimensions.'
                
**Target:**

> 'People interested in geometry, higher dimensions, and a fiction story grounded in mathematics. The book is easy to read but stretches your perceptions of our world through the story of a character in a 2 dimensional world who dares to consider 3 dimensions. The book helps the reader to conceptualize the 4th dimension and higher dimensional understanding. I have considered using excerpts from the book in a middle or high school classroom because of how easy it is to read and understand.'
