<p>The list has been contributed to by 30 different contributors. As this page was compiled automatically and some of the contributors have left their email address (others their G+ page and/or twitter handle) I won't list them here in case it causes more spam but do go take a look at the spreadsheet :).</p>
<p><strong>Go ahead and add any book you have to the list!</strong></p>
<h2 id="some-initial-analysis">Some initial analysis</h2>
<p>I wrote some code to analyse (and in fact write the html behind this site) some aspects of the data set which (last time I checked) contains 65 books.</p>
<h3 id="contributors">Contributors</h3>
<p>The list is completely open but some people seem to contribute more than others. Here's the distribution of the number of guesses:</p>

<p><strong>Authored</strong> by EDWIN A ABBOT</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Flatland is one of the very few novels about math and philosophy that can appeal to almost any layperson. Published in 1880, this short fantasy takes us to a completely flat world of two physical dimensions where all the inhabitants are geometric shapes, and who think the planar world of length and width that they know is all there is. But one inhabitant discovers the existence of a third physical dimension, enabling him to finally grasp the concept of a fourth dimension. Watching our Flatland narrator, we begin to get an idea of the limitations of our own assumptions about reality, and we start to learn how to think about the confusing problem of higher dimensions.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Target:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>'People interested in geometry, higher dimensions, and a fiction story grounded in mathematics. The book is easy to read but stretches your perceptions of our world through the story of a character in a 2 dimensional world who dares to consider 3 dimensions. The book helps the reader to conceptualize the 4th dimension and higher dimensional understanding. I have considered using excerpts from the book in a middle or high school classroom because of how easy it is to read and understand.'</p>

I was going to see a bit of the city but after getting this I ended up sat in a coffee shop with a pencil and notepad for about two hours and did nothing else with my afternoon.
