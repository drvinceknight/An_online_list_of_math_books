# A list of Mathematics books
A repo for some analysis of a book list put together by James Noble and which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvXhcaIlhi4udEFIN1ZSUTRpakotUEZ6QmlEOWNua3c&hl=en&forcehl=1#gid=0).

This code was used for this [blog post](http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/an-online-list-of-mathematics-books.html) and also generates [this website](http://drvinceknight.github.io/An_online_list_of_math_books/) which is a compiled version of the analysis as well as a formatted version of the spreadsheet.
